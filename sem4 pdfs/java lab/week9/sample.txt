Stop words are available in abundance in any human language. By removing these words, we remove the 
low-level information from our text in order to give more focus to the important information . 
In order words , we can say that the removal of such words does not show any negative consequences 
on the model we train for our task . Removal of stop words definitely reduces the dataset size and 
thus reduces the training time due to the fewer number of tokens involved in the training .

English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English , a group of West Germanic 
(Ingvaeonic) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century ,
 are collectively called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with
 the Norman conquest of England; this was a period in which English was influenced by Old French ,
 in particular through its Old Norman dialect.[ 9 ][ 10 ] Early Modern English began in the late 
15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of 
the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift .[ 11 ]
