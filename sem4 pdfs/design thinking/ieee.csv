To evaluate the intervention effects of different methods of health education on Tuberculosis, and provide a health education method which take the best effect. Methods Ten primary and middle schools were selected by stratified random sampling in rural areas of northern Jiangsu Province. There were 6 000 students to finish the questionnaires including the general information, knowledge, attitude, practice of TB prevention and treatment. 100 students per school and three primary and three middle schools were selected by multistage cluster sampling in three rural areas of northern Jiangsu Province. The interviews were divided into two intervention groups (comprehensive intervention and General intervention) and one control group. Results The general awareness rates of core messages on TB were 35.4%. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that sex, age, father education, family type, and family income were significantly associated with increased knowledge scores. The awareness rates of the TB core information of comprehensive intervention group, the general intervention group and the control group were 90.5%, 81.5% and 60.4% after intervention. Conclusion Knowledge on tuberculosis prevention and control should be improved among the primary and middle school students in rural areas of northern Jiangsu Province. Compared with the general intervention group, comprehensive intervention education on TB was suitable for the primary school students in rural areas of northern Jiangsu Province.","","978-1-4244-9171-1","10.1109/RSETE.2011.5964153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5964153","Tuberculosis;primary and middle school students;Health education;Intervention effects","Educational institutions;Diseases;Instruments;Linear regression;Public healthcare","biomedical education;diseases;medical computing;patient treatment;regression analysis;sampling methods","health education;tuberculosis;primary school students;school students;rural areas;northern Jiangsu Province;core message awareness;tuberculosis prevention;tuberculosis treatment;intervention effects;stratified random sampling;multistage cluster sampling;multiple linear regression analysis;sex;age;father education;family type;family income","","","","16","","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study took place in 2009, in the School No. 135 ""Ştefan cel Mare”, placed in Ferentari neighborhood. Method. Participants included 194 children from the second and third grade, 55% boys and 45% girls. We used a 16-questions questionnaire measuring their attitudes and oral health behaviors. The teaching process was based on persuasive communication using audio-visual channels. Results show a change in pupils' behavior, the percent of children that brush their teeth after every meal increased, and the frequency of meals decreased. The attitude toward dental esthetics and intelligence, kindness, age and socio-economic status has changed, the number of the children that are victims of stereotypes decreased. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that using modern, audiovisual channels for sending the message has a significant impact on children. Adjusting the content and the presentation of the message to the age, cognitive development and interests of our target group will lead to important changes in their attitudes toward illness, treatments and dental care.","","978-606-544-078-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6150379","education;oral health;schoolchildren;audiovisual","Dentistry;Pediatrics;Teeth;Educational institutions;Motion pictures;Pain","biomedical education;dentistry;educational aids;teaching","oral health education;audiovisual methods;second grade schoolchildren;third grade schoolchildren;oral health behaviors;persuasive communication;tooth brushing;dental care","","","","10","","13 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we used the pretest-posttest experimental designs. The mobile teaching application -super star xuexitong was taken as the teaching tool. Subjects were divided into the experimental group and the control group and were measured by the Symptom check list-90. In pretest, there was no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group. In posttest, the experimental group's the Symptom checklist-90 scores changed significantly, In addition to psychotic factor, all other factors' scores were significantly lower than the control group, the experimental group's the Symptom check list-90 scores also had great significant differences in pretest and posttest. Similarly, in the questionnaire survey of ""Simple Teaching Effectiveness Evaluation"", there was a significant difference in the satisfaction of the teaching effect between the experimental group and the control group. In terms of satisfaction of teaching effect, the experimental group was significantly better than the control group. The mobile informatization teaching model applied to the teaching practice of mental health education course can improve college students' mental health. Students who used the mobile informatization teaching model showed a higher satisfaction than control group.","","978-1-5386-5059-2","10.1109/IC3.2018.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567231","Mobile Informatization Teaching Model, The Symptom Checklist-90, College Students Mental Health Education Course","Education courses;Psychology;Statistical analysis;Tools;Online services;Sensitivity","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;health and safety;health care;psychology;teaching","college students mental health education course;pretest-posttest experimental designs;teaching tool;teaching practice;mobile informatization teaching model;mobile teaching application;super star xuexitong;simple teaching effectiveness evaluation","","1","","5","","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The full impacts of resource decisions may not be seen until one or more four-year educational cycles have been completed. Policy-makers require tools that will let them easily assess the impacts of a range of possible choices. We present preliminary work on both a Systems Dynamics model and a Markov model designed to do just that. The Markov model is a simple chain of transition probabilities, designed to validate the Systems Dynamics model over a linear range. The Systems Dynamics model presents a more friendly user interface, and is capable of dealing with recursive and non-linear effects of the system. This presentation will describe the structure of the Oregon state higher education system, and show how it is captured in the present model. Some preliminary results will be described.","","978-1-5386-1023-7","10.1109/ICIEV.2017.8338536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8338536","","Education;System dynamics;Markov processes;Informatics;Computational modeling;Tools;User interfaces","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;further education;health care;human computer interaction;medical computing;user interfaces","general education;health services education;resource decisions;Markov model;Oregon state higher education system;systems dynamics model;educational cycles;friendly user interface;recursive effects;nonlinear effects","","","","","","19 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
