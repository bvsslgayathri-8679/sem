Based on the detailed analysis and comparison of various classification algorithms, combined with the characteristics of psychological problem data, C4.5 decision tree algorithm is selected to construct a decision tree model for the psychological problem of symptoms, and uses it to predict the psychological problems of college students. Then the structure model of negative psychology is established by decision tree, and the potential groups with anxiety and depression are found by using clustering technology. The cause analysis based on actual data can provide reliable basis for psychological educators, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of school psychological consultation.","2157-1481","978-1-6654-3892-6","10.1109/ICMTMA52658.2021.00152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9410145","college student;big data;mental health;decision tree;data minting","Cloud computing;Statistical analysis;Education;Mental health;Big Data;Predictive models;Classification algorithms","Big Data;data analysis;decision trees;pattern classification;psychology","big data analysis;management content;college students;big data demand;data awareness;data storage demand;storage technology;universities;modern information technology;mental health education;classification algorithms;psychological problem data;C4.5 decision tree algorithm;decision tree model;psychological problems;negative psychology;clustering technology;cause analysis;psychological educators;school psychological consultation","","","","2","","23 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To evaluate the intervention effects of different methods of health education on Tuberculosis, and provide a health education method which take the best effect. Methods Ten primary and middle schools were selected by stratified random sampling in rural areas of northern Jiangsu Province. There were 6 000 students to finish the questionnaires including the general information, knowledge, attitude, practice of TB prevention and treatment. 100 students per school and three primary and three middle schools were selected by multistage cluster sampling in three rural areas of northern Jiangsu Province. The interviews were divided into two intervention groups (comprehensive intervention and General intervention) and one control group. Results The general awareness rates of core messages on TB were 35.4%. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that sex, age, father education, family type, and family income were significantly associated with increased knowledge scores. The awareness rates of the TB core information of comprehensive intervention group, the general intervention group and the control group were 90.5%, 81.5% and 60.4% after intervention. Conclusion Knowledge on tuberculosis prevention and control should be improved among the primary and middle school students in rural areas of northern Jiangsu Province. Compared with the general intervention group, comprehensive intervention education on TB was suitable for the primary school students in rural areas of northern Jiangsu Province.","","978-1-4244-9171-1","10.1109/RSETE.2011.5964153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5964153","Tuberculosis;primary and middle school students;Health education;Intervention effects","Educational institutions;Diseases;Instruments;Linear regression;Public healthcare","biomedical education;diseases;medical computing;patient treatment;regression analysis;sampling methods","health education;tuberculosis;primary school students;school students;rural areas;northern Jiangsu Province;core message awareness;tuberculosis prevention;tuberculosis treatment;intervention effects;stratified random sampling;multistage cluster sampling;multiple linear regression analysis;sex;age;father education;family type;family income","","","","16","","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Method We selected total of 776 undergraduates in a medical college in Shaanxi province as the research objects. We used “the China's urban residents sub-health status self-rating scale"" to collect information and analyzed the factors which affecting Sub-health of College Students by Multi - factor Logistics Regression. Results It can be seen from this study that the detection rate of sub-health of medical college students is 31.19%, and the fourth grade detection rate of sub-health is higher than that of other grades (F=11.476, P= 0.000), the detection rate of students who's living expenses under 800 yuan increased significantly than other students. (F=8.732, P=0.000). After using the multivariate logistic regression analysis methods, we found that diet situation (OR = 0.732), physical exercise (OR = 0.617), stay up all night (OR = 1.378), employment pressure (OR = 2.453), cell phone usage (OR = 1.907), emotional condition (OR = 1.530), and psychological condition (OR = 1.601) are all the factors of sub-health. The protective factor of sub - health status of college students are eating on time, regular physical exercise. While often stay up all night, the employment pressure, longtime use of mobile phone, anxiety and unhealthy psychological feelings are the risk factors of sub - health status. Conclusion The sub-health detection rate of medical college students is lower than non-medical college students.
