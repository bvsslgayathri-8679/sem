Programs to be covered beyond syllabus: 
1. C program to find the factorial of a given number using recursive and non recursive functions. 
2. C program to display the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Example: If n= 5 it has to print 0 1 1 2 3 3. 
3.Write a general-purpose function to convert any given year into its roman equivalent. The following table shows the roman equivalents of decimal numbers:
Decimal
